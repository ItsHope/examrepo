        The Javascript videos personally helped me. I took down notes and had a lot of aha moments about what Javascript is and how it works. There were confusing parts that I will continue to go through. I know its going to take a lot of practice to fully get familiar with the fundamentals and it will pay off when its time to create my web art as I have been drawn to art that is going to need me to have somewhat strong coding skills. I really really loved Khutso Nkadimeng's internet art that explored the ideas of internet geopolitics and access. 

                I found the readings interesting and the concept of web art interesting in general. I'm a fan of the internet. I think humans are brilliant for the internet and anything that is good becomes better with the internet or rather has potential to. In The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet by David, he speaks on how today, the original artifact matters less than the reproductions.  "You see the work better – that is, closer, in more detail – online than in person" (Carrier, 202). I watched an online gallery once during the national lockdown and the experience was beautiful. I was immersed because of the music, the special effects etc.

        The API videos were informative, the real test for full understanding will be me actually working with API's and extracting data or even more advanced live data online. Getting these concepts and JavaScript in general is going to require real consistent practice, at least that's how I learn. I have though made a lot of progress in my skills.  

Week 4's reading was interesting. Steven Mailloux discusses the concept of convention and context in literature deeply, which made me think about conventions in general and my understanding of them. One part of the paper that I found interesting was his discussion of the theorist, Bert O. States. States explains how traditional conventions are established, "through observation of an innovative practice", he claims that the innovative shocks the audience and even the medium. (States as quoted in Mailloux, 1983). This brings about adoption of the practice if the other artists adopt the practice. This was interesting to me because of the "if", it meant that conventions relied on unity. Paul Alpers another theorist, revealed in his thesis that "convening reminds us that conventions describe individuals coming together". If other artists do not adopt the innovative practice, there will not be a new convention, there is no guarantee, it's all by chance unless a prescriptive convection. This reliance on unity, for me further emphasized the definition Mailloux gave at the beginning of the paper. Conventions refer to "shared practices".  

Prescriptive conventions though,mean the community in question is put pressure on to follow a certain way of doing things, but outside of literature, how? Is this done legally? These are the questions I was left with. Through the examples made in Mailloux's commentary, I agree that context is significant in both traditional convention and prescriptive convention. Both explanatory concepts are context specific. The reading helped me also think about conventions within web art like interactivity and conventions within web design like navbar placements etc.  References- Few, S. (2007).

Going through internet art that was provided and doing research in general, I am finding a lot of art I like and drawing inspiration and gaining confidence as I get better coding skills. I am still stuck on colourful visuals and meaning interaction for my internet art.

        My choice of net/web art to analyze is Indirect Flights. This piece of art is one I had to grow to understand. At first glance it is chaotic and hard to make out of. But like what internet art means, the tools that the internet offers make it better. If I would, I would say the internet tools give it an aura. Benjamin describes the aura as “a phenomena’s uniqueness” (Benjamin, 2015). His theory suggests that every original piece of art has an aura, for example, “the aura of the sunset, the aura of nature” (Benjamin, 2015) that cannot be replaced. Therefore, mechanically or technologically reproduced art refuses to appreciate or acknowledge that aura. I arguably suggest that internet tools give art that aura, things like interactivity and animation. Benjamin speaks on this in "The Work Of Art In The Age Of The Internet" by acknowledging the aura in netart "art on the internet still has evidence of contemplative emersion that usually is lost in mechanically reproduced art". While viewing Indirect Flight, I found myself staring like I normally would at an original artpiece. I look at every colour and every element, all the details. I will say in detail because the internet offers tools to view visuals better. “The display system has changed, you see the work better, close ups and etc.” (Carrier, 2020). A lot of my classmates and Danae argued that net art can be seen as clunky, uncool and old fashioned. I felt that for a lot of the net art I viewed, Indirect Flight can be seen as that too. I argue though that this is only the case at first glance. I don't think viewers in the 80s were able to view art like how we do. With just how clear it is, I was able to appreciate and see the creators vision, I hope. The layering of the images is so odd and captivating, and I think internet art is only going to get even better with interactivity emerging and technology improving. Net Art pieces can also be viewed with music to assist with immersion just like Indirect Flights and my Internet Artwork (The collage). That makes the experience so much better.

        <MainHeading>My Essay</MainHeading>
        <BlogText>
        In this paper I do an analysis on the net art called "SCREENFULL" by Abe Linkoln and
Jimpunk developed in 2004 till 2005 (Available here: http://www.screenfull.net/stadium/). This
is net art addresses my area of interest conceptually, aesthetically and technically. For my last
assignment my interest and final net artwork came down to presenting or displaying multimedia
in interesting and creative ways or creating experimental collages.
I created an interactive collage to showcase Jack Stauber's artwork. Jack Stauber is an artist and
animator known for his unique art style that can be described as odd, surreal and chaotic, his
overall style is very unconventional. My design goals were to create a blog in theme with his art
style. I fell short and was limited by still wanting familiarity in my blog for easy usability and
this is why I resonate with Screenfull particularly. Screenfull surpassed my vision of what a
functional chaotic website would look and feel like. It is truly experimental and looks like a blog
by Jack Stauber. It is an interesting net artwork.
To define what net art is, net art is "a self-explanatory term that is created by a malfunctioning
piece of software originally used to create an art and communications activity that is on the
internet" (Bookchin and Shulgin, 1999 as cited in Park, 2007). The essence of net art is to push a
lot of boundaries. Screenfull pushed a lot of boundaries. According to Net Art Anthology at the
time of development, Screenfull was a response to the new web 2.0 with unique blogging but it
was also an attempt to break it. The artists of Screenfull describe and claim that they have
created a website with so much media that it will crash your computer, "the project was loud and
crowded, it took a rather maximalist approach to design and content" (Net Art Anthology). After
having viewed the site, I find that the description cannot be more accurate.From the period of 2004 to 2005 the co-creators frequently blogged looped videos, images that
seem abstract at first glance and of course the audio, the audio for me emphasized the
overwhelming experience the creators promised, it is always played at full blast and does not
start playing right away. My first time experiencing this I thought someone had hacked into my
machine. The whole blog is a multilayered collage. This collage consists of media that just seems
to be working to overload the user as the creators intended but the media is intentional and
speaks on controversial topics like war, religion, UFO's just to name a few. Some webpages even
contain content about net art and its artists, how anonymity and aliases were a significant part of
early net art. Both creators did not go by their real names at the time, Abe Linkoln and Jimpunk
are artist or created names for the individuals. This made me think about a statement made by Ji
Yong Park in his paper " Design principles for interactive user experience through net art" about
net artworks having an element of activism "An understanding of artists that create net art as
activists in cyberspace is very crucial to understanding web design principles in terms of the user
experience" (Park, 2007).
There are provocative sounds with swearing that play over each other, one is usually someone
speaking, and the rest is different songs, all to communicate a message and in some webpages to
bring about a certain reaction. The images and videos on the blog are placed without containers,
they are different sizes, and some are overlayed. The images are altered and have effects. The
images are internet sourced images that are photoshopped to have a particular aesthetic. "The
posts often make use of Photoshop’s blinking magnetic lasso tool" (Net Art Anthology).
The placement of elements seems very random and not thought of. In general, the interface is
unconventional and as intended the user is likely to experience some sensory overload and
shock. " The audience is shocked because traditional conventions function not only as options for
the artist but also as expectations for his viewers or readers"(Mailloux, 1983). Since this is
intended and it aligns with the design goals of wanting to, "crash your browser with content"(Net
Art Anthology) this was greatly achieved. Some webpages even do feel like a crashing page
because they take time to load all the content, the pitch-black landing page itself seems broken
until you click on the link that directs you to the homepage.The description of net art above highlighted the significance of the internet in the phenomena of
net art, the blog as art would not be without the internet. The internet brings about interaction
with website elements like buttons, images, play and pause audio features to get an output.
Screenfull makes use of a lot of buttons that are all white with black text like the rest of the text
on the homepage. The buttons don't look like conventional buttons, they don't even function like
conventional buttons that usually animate on hover. I was able to distinguish their function
because of the change in cursors when you hover over them. Upon interaction and clicking on
them, users are directed to different webpages with different content. The site is significantly
overloaded with buttons that lead to webpages with even more buttons. It felt like an endless
cycle. For me that's when an element of adventure and storytelling I felt was introduced. I got
lost between webpages with unique interfaces, colorways, images and audio. Each webpage told
a unique story and featured distinct interaction, some webpages contained buttons and that
opened popup boxes for commentary.
The layout and aesthetic of the images and flash videos make use of the internet. The
implementation of such functionality and strategic placing is using computer Technlogies and
code. Other images in webpages seem non-interactive until you click on them and a box with
animated text pops up. The message usually emphasizes the content on that particular page.
Almost all the webpages on Screenfull have at least 3 audio elements on a single page with
music playing over each other. As a user you can interact with the pause and play buttons as well
as the volume functionality. You can choose to listen to an audio sound at time and at which
volume percentage or even no sound at all. I really enjoyed this optionality because I was able to
focus and read, in general focus and understand one type of media at a time. This is a part which
makes me lean with Screenfull being functional. The internet makes this project.
In conclusion, Screenfull is an impressive net art today so I cannot image the impact it had in the
early 2000s. It is not conventional and does not consider a lot of web design rules such as having
a consistent header in all webpages, having a footer. The blog does not consider colour theory,
text sizing and element placement.

You touch on important points here but do not delve into them. This is a crucial discussion for your essay but the argument is a bit limited and does not fully elaborate on the use of the internet as a medium in the work.

Yet the blog still functions, some design rules were still followed to some extent. Cursors change
to indicate button functionality. There is consistency in the colour of elements. The site is also
responsive. I feel that that if the artists wanted to create a familiar blog and post blogs they
would have done that. Screenfull is fascinating and intentional even though it does not feel like it
and anyone with a tolerance of experimental art would appreciate it. It is true to the essence of
net art, it pushes boundaries and is an experience. I have went over the blog multiple times and
still find new media to look at, new educational content to engage with, and that is the beauty of
this project.Yet the blog still functions, some design rules were still followed to some extent. Cursors change
